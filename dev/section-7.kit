                    Welcome to Drexel University and welcome to the office of International Students and Scholars Services (ISSS). A student's affiliation with ISSS begins immediately after the admission process and continues well beyond graduation. ISSS staff can advise international students, scholars and faculty on immigration, cultural, financial, academic and personal concerns, and makes appropriate referrals when necessary.
